    executiveSummary:
      'ADM Retail Platform is a production system that eliminates manual product data work for retail teams. A supplier uploads an Excel file; the platform ingests it, enriches missing attributes with an LLM, classifies every product into the correct taxonomy node, queues the batch for human sign-off, and pushes approved records to Shopify. The pipeline runs on AWS and is designed to handle enterprise catalog volumes.',

    problem:
      'Retail teams managing large catalogs face three compounding problems. First, supplier data arrives incomplete — model numbers, dimensions, and materials are frequently absent or inconsistent. Second, products must be placed in the correct taxonomy leaf before Shopify will surface them correctly in search and navigation, and manual classification at scale is error-prone. Third, pushing hundreds of approved products to Shopify without automation is tedious and crash-prone. Each problem multiplies with catalog size.',

    whyBuilt:
      'Manual product data preparation is one of the most labor-intensive workflows in retail operations — skilled people spending most of their time on data hygiene tasks that follow predictable patterns. The ADM platform exists to demonstrate that an AI-powered pipeline can own the repetitive parts of this workflow, while keeping humans in control of the approval gate before anything reaches production.',

    realWorldUseCase:
      'A fashion retailer receives a 500-row Excel file from a new supplier. Product names are present but descriptions are thin, size information is inconsistent, and the category column uses the supplier\'s internal codes rather than the store\'s taxonomy. ADM ingests the file, normalises the column schema, uses an LLM to fill missing descriptions and standardise size values, maps each product to the correct taxonomy leaf, and surfaces the batch in the review dashboard. The team approves 480 products, rejects 20 with notes, and the 480 are published to Shopify — no manual data entry.',

        solution: 'Products with the same normalised item name were receiving different taxonomy paths on each run because the LLM classifier is non-deterministic. Added a post-classification pass that groups products by normalised item name and enforces path agreement within the batch — any disagreement flags the group for human review rather than silently publishing inconsistent paths.',
      },
      {
        challenge: 'Shopify rate limits under bulk push operations',
        solution: 'Shopify Admin API enforces per-minute call limits. Bulk pushes of 500+ products exceeded these limits, causing silent request failures. Implemented a token-bucket rate limiter in the publisher service: requests queue and release at the allowed rate. 429 responses trigger exponential backoff with jitter. Failed pushes after max retries are written to a retry queue and re-attempted in the next batch window.',
      },
      {
        challenge: 'LLM hallucination on specific product attributes',
        solution: 'The LLM occasionally generated plausible-but-fabricated values — model numbers that did not exist, dimensions outside the product category\'s realistic range. Every LLM response is now validated against a Pydantic model with category-specific field constraints. Responses that fail validation trigger a retry with a corrective prompt naming the specific invalid field. After two failed retries the field is left empty and flagged for human completion.',
      },
    ],

    decisions: [
      {
        decision: 'Event-driven batch pipeline (S3 + Lambda) instead of synchronous API processing',
        rationale: 'Synchronous processing of large Excel files during the HTTP request blocks the API, causes upload timeouts for the client, and does not scale — a 1000-row file takes too long for a synchronous response. Moving batch processing to S3+Lambda decouples file ingestion from the API entirely: the uploader gets an immediate acknowledgment, and processing happens asynchronously with automatic Lambda scaling.',
        tradeoff: 'Added operational complexity — monitoring Lambda functions separately from the API, handling distributed failures, and a delayed feedback loop where the uploader must poll for status rather than receiving immediate results. Worth the tradeoff for the reliability improvement under production upload volumes.',
      },
      {
        decision: 'Human-in-the-loop review gate before every Shopify publish',
        rationale: 'AI enrichment and taxonomy classification are high-confidence but not infallible. Publishing incorrect data to a live Shopify store is costly to reverse — wrong prices, wrong categories, and wrong descriptions directly impact sales and SEO. A mandatory review gate catches edge cases the AI misses and builds client trust by making the process transparent.',
        tradeoff: 'Slower time-to-publish per batch. For clients with well-structured supplier data, this gate adds unnecessary delay. A future configuration option to skip review for high-confidence batches would improve throughput without removing the safety net for ambiguous cases.',
      },
      {
        decision: 'Pydantic schema validation on every LLM response as a hard requirement, not optional',
        rationale: 'LLMs produce inconsistently-typed responses even with strong system prompts. Without mandatory validation, malformed data reaches the database silently — wrong types, missing required fields, values in unexpected formats. Making validation a hard gate means the system fails loudly on bad responses rather than storing corrupt records that surface as bugs later.',
        tradeoff: 'Higher initial rejection rate from the LLM layer, requiring a retry loop. The corrective retry prompt resolves most failures on the second attempt, so the practical impact on processing time is small. The tradeoff is explicitly accepted: noisy retries are better than silent data corruption.',
      },
    ],

    performance: [
      'Async FastAPI route handlers allow concurrent request processing without blocking',
      'LLM enrichment runs in batches of N products per API call instead of one-at-a-time — reduces total API calls and latency',
      'PostgreSQL indexes on product_id, batch_id, and status columns keep dashboard queries fast as the record count grows',
      'AWS Lambda scales automatically with upload volume — concurrent Lambda executions process large batches in parallel',
    ],

    security: [
      'Shopify API access token stored as an environment variable — never committed to version control',
      'All FastAPI endpoints require authentication — unauthenticated requests are rejected at the dependency layer',
      'S3 bucket configured with write-only access from Lambda — no public read access to uploaded supplier files',
      'LLM prompts are sanitised before submission — product data fields that contain user-controlled text are escaped to prevent prompt injection',
    ],

    scalability: [
      'FastAPI service is stateless — multiple instances can run behind a load balancer without shared in-process state',
      'AWS Lambda scales automatically with the number of concurrent S3 events — no infrastructure changes needed for larger upload volumes',
      'PostgreSQL can be migrated to Amazon RDS Aurora for read replica support as query volume grows',
      'Shopify publisher respects rate limits independently of instance count — each instance manages its own token bucket',
    ],

    testing:
      'Unit tests cover the taxonomy classifier, column schema detector, Pydantic validators, and the Shopify rate limiter. Integration tests run against a Shopify development store (separate API credentials from production) and a test PostgreSQL database seeded with sample supplier data. Lambda functions are tested locally with sample S3 event payloads before deployment. The React dashboard is manually QA\'d for the approval workflow, specifically the reject-with-notes and re-queue flows.',

    results: [
      'Product data preparation reduced from multi-day manual workflows to an automated pipeline with a single upload step',
      'Taxonomy classification consistency enforced programmatically across all batches — no manual cross-checking required',
      'Zero malformed records reach Shopify — validation layer catches all LLM formatting errors before the publish step',
      'AWS Lambda handles import volume spikes without blocking the API or requiring manual intervention',
      'Human review gate provides an auditable approval record for every product published to the store',
    ],

    lessonsLearned: [
      'Schema validation on every LLM response is non-negotiable in production. The cost of a retry loop is far lower than the cost of debugging silent data corruption downstream.',
      'Human review gates are valuable not just for quality control but for client trust. Seeing exactly which products the AI classified and being able to override before anything goes live builds confidence in the system.',
      'S3 + Lambda was the correct decoupling choice even though it added operational complexity. Synchronous processing would have been simpler to implement but fragile under real upload volumes.',
      'Corrective retry prompts (telling the LLM specifically what it got wrong) resolve the vast majority of schema validation failures — a generic "try again" prompt does not.',

It uses Perplexity sonar-pro for the primary extraction, Google Gemini for independent verification and gap-filling, validates the merged result against a JSON schema, and stores it in IndexedDB. The user can review, edit, and export all extracted records as CSV or JSON at any time.',

    problem:
      'E-commerce and procurement teams copy product specifications manually from supplier and manufacturer websites into spreadsheets. A single product page can contain dozens of attributes scattered across tables, tabs, description sections, and specification panels. Manual copying is slow, inconsistent, and introduces transcription errors — and it scales linearly with catalog size, making it impractical for large catalogs.',

    whyBuilt:
      'The two-model verification approach was the central design hypothesis: a single LLM can extract product attributes, but it makes systematic errors that are invisible until they propagate to a spreadsheet. By using a second independent model from a different provider, the system gets genuine second-opinion coverage rather than a model confirming what it already produced. This architecture was tested against single-model extraction and showed measurable improvement in attribute recall and value accuracy.',

    realWorldUseCase:
      'A procurement analyst is sourcing industrial components from 40 different supplier websites. Each website has a different layout — some use specification tables, some embed specs in the product description, some split data across tabs. DTLP extracts the part number, material grade, dimensions, tolerance, operating temperature, and certifications from each page in a single click, regardless of layout. At the end of the session, the analyst exports all 40 records as a CSV for the engineering team.',

        solution: 'MV3 service workers terminate after inactivity, which can interrupt in-flight API calls. Restructured the extraction flow so that each LLM call is a single self-contained async operation. The result is written to IndexedDB before the service worker can be suspended — no multi-step stateful workflows that span worker activations.',
      },
      {
        challenge: 'Dual-model result merging strategy — priority conflicts when both models produce different values for the same field',
        solution: 'Defined a clear merge priority: sonar-pro values take precedence because it reads live web content more reliably; Gemini fills only the fields that sonar-pro left empty. When both models provide a value for the same field, the values are compared — if they match, the field gets a "confirmed" flag; if they differ, sonar-pro\'s value is used and the field is flagged "unverified" in the stored record.',

        solution: 'On validation failure, the retry prompt includes the specific JSON schema error message and the field name that failed. Example: "The \'weight\' field must be a string like \'2.5 kg\', not a number. Correct this field and return the full attribute object again." Corrective prompting resolves the majority of validation failures on the second attempt. After three failed retries, the field is left null and flagged for manual completion.',

    decisions: [
      {
        decision: 'Two separate LLM providers instead of one model with self-correction',
        rationale: 'A model correcting its own output is biased toward confirming what it already produced — it is likely to make the same systematic errors. Using a model from a different provider as the verifier gives independent judgment. In head-to-head testing on product pages, dual-model recall was measurably higher than single-model with retry.',
        tradeoff: 'Two API calls per extraction doubles the API cost per extraction and slightly increases latency. Mitigated by batching: both models receive the same captured page content in the same session, so no additional page fetching is needed. The quality improvement justifies the additional cost for professional use cases.',

IndexedDB supports gigabytes of structured data, is queryable by any field (domain, date, category), and supports binary blobs for future attachment storage. For a tool collecting data across hundreds of pages, IndexedDB is the only viable option.',
        tradeoff: 'IndexedDB has a verbose, callback-based API compared to the simpler chrome.storage API. Abstracted behind a db.js utility module that exposes a clean async interface — the complexity is isolated to one file.',
      },
      {
        decision: 'All API calls in the service worker, not in content scripts',
        rationale: 'Content scripts run inside the page context and are subject to that page\'s Content Security Policy. Many supplier sites have strict CSPs that block arbitrary fetch calls to external domains — including the Perplexity and Gemini APIs. Moving all LLM calls to the service worker bypasses the page CSP entirely, since service workers have their own network context.',
        tradeoff: 'Requires a message-passing hop between the content script and service worker for every extraction. Adds a small latency overhead and more code to maintain. The tradeoff is mandatory — there is no reliable way to make external API calls from a content script on sites with strict CSPs.',

    performance: [
      'Page content is captured once per extraction and sent to both LLMs without re-fetching the page',

      'Records are indexed by domain and extraction date in IndexedDB for fast popup queries even with thousands of stored records',

      'No product data is sent anywhere except the Perplexity and Gemini API endpoints on explicit user action',
      'Content Security Policy in manifest.json restricts the extension\'s own script origins',
      'Page content is captured only on user click — the extension never passively monitors page content',

      'IndexedDB handles tens of thousands of extracted records without performance degradation',
      'For team use, the CSV/JSON export workflow handles sharing without requiring a shared backend',
      'A future team mode could add a lightweight sync server using the existing export format as the transfer format',
    ],

    testing:
      'Tested against product pages from 20+ supplier and manufacturer websites covering different page layouts: structured specification tables, prose descriptions with embedded specs, multi-tab product pages, and non-English content. The JSON schema validator is unit-tested with a library of sample valid and invalid LLM responses, including edge cases like missing required fields, wrong types, and unexpected nesting. Service worker lifecycle edge cases (suspended worker during extraction) are tested by artificially reducing the service worker idle timeout in development.',

    results: [

    executiveSummary:
      'AI Trading Extension is a two-part system: a Chrome extension that injects a live trading intelligence panel into any charting website, and a local Flask backend that fetches real-time OHLCV data from Binance, runs 14 classical candlestick pattern detectors, and returns an AI-generated trade recommendation. Everything runs locally on the user\'s machine — no trading data transits a remote server.',

    problem:
      'Retail traders monitor charts, pattern libraries, and trade journals in separate browser tabs. Spotting classical candlestick patterns manually under live market conditions is slow and error-prone. The context switch between the chart and an analysis tool costs time and attention during fast-moving markets. Patterns that are time-sensitive lose value if detection is delayed by manual analysis.',

    whyBuilt:
      'The central insight is that pattern detection from OHLCV data is a deterministic mathematical operation — it does not require ML. The 14 most commonly traded classical patterns can be encoded as explicit ratio-checking functions. This makes detection reliable, explainable, and fast. The AI layer adds market-context interpretation on top of the deterministic detection, not as a replacement for it.',

    realWorldUseCase:
      'A trader has a Binance chart open for BTCUSDT on a 1-hour timeframe. The AI Trading Extension overlay is visible in the top-right corner of the browser. The extension polls the Flask backend every 60 seconds. When a Bullish Engulfing pattern is confirmed on the most recent candle, the overlay updates to show the pattern name, the detected candle information, and the AI recommendation: "Bullish signal. Engulfing pattern at key support level, volume above 20-period average. Consider long entry above the high of the engulfing candle."',

Running the backend on localhost eliminates all three concerns — no data leaves the machine except the public Binance market data request.',
        tradeoff: 'Users must install Python and start the backend manually. There is no push-button "cloud" mode. This is an acceptable complexity for trading tools where privacy and latency matter.

An ML-based detector would add opacity ("why did it fire here?"), require training data with labeled pattern occurrences, and introduce model drift over time. Deterministic functions are debuggable, testable against historical data, and produce fully explainable results — important for a tool traders use to make financial decisions.',
        tradeoff: 'The pattern library is fixed to the 14 patterns currently implemented. Novel or informal patterns are not detected. Adding a new pattern requires writing a new function. An ML layer could potentially generalise, but that generalisation would come at the cost of explainability, which is unacceptable in a trading context.',
      },
      {
        decision: 'Overlay panel injection instead of a standalone popup',
        rationale: 'Traders look at their chart while making decisions — switching to an extension popup requires taking focus off the chart. Injecting a floating overlay keeps the signal visible while the chart is visible, preserving the trading context entirely. A Hammer pattern signal seen next to the candle that generated it is more actionable than the same signal in a separate panel.',
